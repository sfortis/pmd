A small script made for ASUS routers running Merlin firmware, which is trying to detect the current Activision server, retrieves geographical IP date and using Skynet ( https://github.com/Adamm00/IPSet_ASUS#help ) allows you to ban the server IP,IP range or the whole country (probable makes no sense, but i added this because i can).


Prerequisites: 

- Asus router with Merlin Firmware installed
- JFFS enabled


Installation:

1. Download the script in /JFFS partition
2. Give execution permissions ( chmod +x pmd.sh )
3. Edit the script and customize the variables / paths.
